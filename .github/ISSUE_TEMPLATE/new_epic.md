Introduction
Product requirement
Technical requirement
Design requirement

**INTRODUCTION**
You should explain the ‘why’ and ‘what’ about the epic.
If you are writing an epic to develop a new feature include why you have decided to develop this feature, what are the user needs you are trying to solve and what are you trying to achieve with this new feature along with the metric you plan to use for measuring the achievement of the new feature. In addition, if you have any documentation or early wireframes for the feature include those in the introduction to provide as much clear picture & information you can provide to your team. 
1. summary of what the features you’re building are for and why you’re building them
2. what metrics you are trying to improve
3. links to specific documentation
4. marketing plans, legal requirements (if any)
5. early wireframes

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENT**
An essential part of the epic where you provide with an explanation for the whole team working on it to understand what are they going to design, build, test or release. For example, if you are building a feature that the feature has to be fast or should be available in multiple languages, or should work on multiple devices like mobile, tablet and desktop should be mentioned in the product requirement section of your epic.

**DESIGN REQUIREMENTS**
While writing the design requirement collaborate with your UX designer as much as you can. Take their input as there might be things that a designer thinks is important in order to have a better user experience which wouldn't cross your mind. For example, a designer might think the preview should be of a certain size and the profile picture should always maintain certain resolution in order for a good experience than those kinds of requirement should be written here.

**ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS**
Similar to the design requirement in this part of the epic try to involve the engineers or tech lead as much as possible. Their inputs in the early stage will be very useful while estimation and building it correctly. For example, the engineering team might want to build an API to integrate with some other system in order to fetch and maintain the quality of an image, those kinds of specifications and requirements should be mentioned under engineering requirements.
